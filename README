Node.js Express App: Jenkins CI/CD & Kubernetes
This repository features a Node.js Express application integrated with a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline for automated containerization and Kubernetes orchestration.

Tech Stack
Runtime: Node.js

Framework: Express.js

CI/CD: Jenkins

Containerization: Docker

Orchestration: Kubernetes

Deployment Instructions
1. Local Setup
To run the application directly on your machine:

Bash

npm install
node index.js
The app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

2. Docker
The dockerfile uses a node:slim base image to package the application.

Bash

# Build the image
docker build -t nodeapp-test .

# Run the container (Mapped to Internal Port 3000)
docker run -p 3000:3000 nodeapp-test
3. Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline
The Jenkinsfile automates the full lifecycle:

Build: Creates the Docker image.

Push: Pushes the image to Docker Hub under jemimaht/k8s-jenkins-aws.

Deploy: Automatically applies Kubernetes manifests.

4. Kubernetes
Deployment is managed via the included manifests:

deployment.yml: Configures 1 replica and listens on port 3000.

deploymentservice.yml: Exposes the app via a LoadBalancer on Port 5000.

Manual Deployment Commands:

Bash

kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
kubectl apply -f deploymentservice.yml

 Repository Structure
index.js: Express server logic with /, /will, and /ready endpoints.

Jenkinsfile: Pipeline-as-code for automated deployment.

dockerfile: Optimized Docker build instructions.

deployment.yml: Kubernetes deployment manifest.

package.json: Project dependencies (express, mocha, supertest).
