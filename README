Node.js Express: Automated CI/CD on Amazon EKS Project Overview
This repository features a Node.js 24 (LTS) Express application integrated with an automated Jenkins CI/CD pipeline. The workflow ensures that every code change is automatically built, containerized using optimized Docker images, and deployed to a scalable Amazon EKS cluster.

Tech Stack
Runtime: Node.js 24 (LTS)

Framework: Express.js

CI/CD: Jenkins (Declarative Pipeline)

Containerization: Docker (node:24-slim)

Orchestration: AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

Deployment Instructions
1. Local Setup
To run the application directly on your machine:

Bash

npm install
node index.js
The app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

2. Docker Execution
The application is packaged using a slim base image and runs as a non-root user for stability.

Bash

# Build the production image
docker build -t nodeapp-prod:latest .

# Run the container (Mapped to Internal Port 3000)
docker run -p 3000:3000 nodeapp-prod:latest
3. Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline
The Jenkinsfile automates the following phases:

Build: Installs dependencies using npm ci for consistent builds.

Push: Tags and uploads the versioned image to jemimaht/k8s-jenkins-aws.

Deploy: Updates the EKS cluster deployment using the latest build image.

4. Kubernetes Configuration
Deployment is managed via two primary manifests:

deployment.yml: Manages the application lifecycle and replica count.

deploymentservice.yml: Exposes the app via a LoadBalancer on Port 5000.

Manual Commands:

Bash

kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
kubectl apply -f deploymentservice.yml
